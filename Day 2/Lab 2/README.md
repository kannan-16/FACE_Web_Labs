# LAB | Dream Team
    
Alex is a young enterprenuer who is out to assemble his own football team. Ambitious much? Well, he seems to have to resources to do it though. He has collected data of players across various teams. He now needs to arrange this data so he can make sense of it. He needs an application that will help him compare and contrast abilities of different players.

Alas, for all the money in the world, he can't find a decent programmer to help him with this task. He's designed the front-end of the application and it looks great. He needs YOU to help him code functionalities in the back-end though.
