## LAB | Chocolate Dispenser
    
Caitlyn loved chocolates and asked her mum to buy her a truck of chocolates. Her mum wasn't as generous, but she did buy Cait a tiny chocolate dispenser. However, she didn't teach Cait how to operate it. She would only give her one chocolate a day. Cait obviously wanted more, so much more.

Cait is now on a quest to create a virtual terminal which can directly access the chocolate machine. She needs **YOU** to help her code functionalities in the back-end though. Go to the `src/app.js` file and complete all the unfinished code to satiate her sweet tooth.

## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo
- Practice JavaScript basics - _operators, conditions, loops_

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "done"
  git push origin master
  ```

- Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.

## Starter code

The `src/app.js` contains an array of 100 chocolates. We are talking about the 100 _strings_ that specifies the color of each chocolate. Available chocolates are of the colors `green, red, purple, blue, crimson, silver, pink`.

### Tests

Ohh yes! We have our beloved tests, and you already know how this works. Open the `SpecRunner.html` file on your browser and start coding to pass the test. Remember to focus on one test at a time and read carefully the instructions to understand what you have to do.

## Trial 1: MORE! MORE! MORE!

Hundred chocolates? Not enough! We certainly need more. Create a function `addChocolates()` which takes `color, count` as arguments and adds them to the dispenser from the top.

## Trial 2: LESS! LESS! LESS!

We have added too many chocolates and the machine has started to malfunction. Create a function `removeChocolates()` that takes `number` as an argument and _returns an array of chocolates_ that have been removed from the top.

## Trial 3: One is not enough!

Cait can't have just one chocolate a day. So our next task would be to create a function `dispenseChocolates()` that dispenses chocolate at will. It takes `number` as an argument and _returns an array of chocolates_ from the bottom.

## Trial 4: My favourite color is...

Cait is annoyed with all the green chocolates she's been getting. Time to change things up a bit. Create a function `dispenseChocolatesOfColor()` which takes `number, color` as arugments and _return an array of chocolates_ from the bottom of the given color.

## Trial 5: LED my chocos!

Cait is finding it difficult to keep track of her chocolates. You'll need to create an LED that shows her how many of each chocolate are remaining. Create a function `noOfChocolates()` that _returns an array of number of chocolates_ in the order `[green, red, purple, blue, crimson, silver, pink]`.

## Trial 6: One a penny, two a penny, hot cross shoots!



## Trial 7: But, where do you come from?



## Trial 8: This, that and then some more...



## Challenge 1: Old is gold.



## Challenge 2: Team Game



## Judgement 1: The devil is in the details



## Judgement 2: The golden goal
